# Spellbreak Subreddit-CSS
This subreddit stylesheet was initially designed for the Spellbreak subreddit. I'm a fan of their game so far and figured I would reach out to them with a cool fun fan-creation. Their community manager seemed hesitant to outsource this to their community, but I made it anyways. Feel free to use this Stylesheet for any subreddit, don't worry about credit or anything like that.

6. Hit "save" and enjoy your new CSS look!

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Reddit at /u/gearphreak. There are probably some bugs that I'd be happy to amend (flexbox is weird) so let me know if you find any. Enjoy!
