# Spellbreak Subreddit-CSS
This subreddit stylesheet was initially designed for the Spellbreak subreddit. I'm a fan of their game so far and figured I would reach out to them with a cool fun fan-creation. Their community manager seemed hesitant to outsource this to their community, but I made it anyways. Feel free to use this Stylesheet for any subreddit, don't worry about credit or anything like that.
